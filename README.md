Experimenting with how Diffie-Hellman key exchange works and how difficult it is to decrypt a message after intercepting the base, modulus and public keys in a MITM attack.

Run:
```bash
deno run index.ts
```

Work in progress. Also, I don't know a thing about cryptography, so please don't take this too seriously.
