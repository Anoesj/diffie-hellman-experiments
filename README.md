Experimenting with how Diffie-Hellman key exchange works and how difficult it is to decrypt a message after intercepting the base, modulus and public keys in a MITM attack.

Run:
```bash
deno run index.ts
```

Work in progress. Also, I don't know a thing about cryptography, so please don't take this too seriously.

This script should output something like:
```
[Alice] I‚Äôm a new actor with private key: 3779n
[Bob] I‚Äôm a new actor with private key: 4049n
[Tom] I‚Äôm a new actor with private key: 3023n
Creating communication line between Alice and Bob. Interceptors: [ "Tom" ]
Actors agreed upon the following communication parameters: { base: 2689n, modulus: 2897n }
[Alice] Calculated public key: 1395n
